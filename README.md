# Sign-Up-Form

02/14/22

For my next project, I will be creating a sign-up form that mimicks a design provided by The Odin Project.  I am familiar with most of the techniques needed to complete this, but it will be a good review of the new HTML and CSS lessons I have learned over the past week. By the end of this project, I am looking to be more familiar with structuring, styling, and validating forms made with HTML and CSS.

I am saving the credits for images and such below in this README until I have applied them to my page.

I have now finished my sign-up form project.  Personally, I found this to be the perfect challenge for my skill level.  I had to refer back to the previous lessons to remember how to do things with forms and css.  I would say resizing the page was finicky.  I was wondering how the Odin example did it so easily, and I realized it was because it was a single image rather than a webpage.  The resizing still feels a little off to me, but now everything stays on the page in a relatively clean manner.  I am quite curious to see how developing a webiste for both desktop and mobile browsers works.  This form would not look good on a mobile browser.  This was a great review for what I have learned.  I will probably need to look up how to do some things again in the future, but that is part of the fun of programming.
