# Sign-Up-Form

02/14/22

For my next project, I will be creating a sign-up form that mimicks a design provided by The Odin Project.  I am familiar with most of the techniques needed to complete this, but it will be a good review of the new HTML and CSS lessons I have learned over the past week. By the end of this project, I am looking to be more familiar with structuring, styling, and validating forms made with HTML and CSS.

I am saving the credits for images and such below in this README until I have applied them to my page.
